    "# Collision Avoidance - Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran through the basic motion notebook, hopefully you're enjoying how easy it can be to make your Jetbot move around! Thats very cool!  But what's even cooler, is making JetBot move around all by itself!  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a super hard task, that has many different approaches but the whole problem is usually broken down into easier sub-problems.  It could be argued that one of the most\n",
    "important sub-problems to solve, is the problem of preventing the robot from entering dangerous situations!  We're calling this *collision avoidance*. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this set of notebooks, we're going to attempt to solve the problem using deep learning and a single, very versatile, sensor: the camera.  You'll see how with a neural network, camera, and the NVIDIA Jetson Nano, we can teach the robot a very useful behavior!\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we take to avoiding collisions is to create a virtual \"safety bubble\" around the robot.  Within this safety bubble, the robot is able to spin in a circle without hitting any objects (or other dangerous situations like falling off a ledge).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the robot is limited by what's in it's field of vision, and we can't prevent objects from being placed behind the robot, etc.  But we can prevent the robot from entering these scenarios itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we'll do this is super simple:  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll manually place the robot in scenarios where it's \"safety bubble\" is violated, and label these scenarios ``blocked``.  We save a snapshot of what the robot sees along with this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we'll manually place the robot in scenarios where it's safe to move forward a bit, and label these scenarios ``free``.  Likewise, we save a snapshot along with this label.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all that we'll do in this notebook; data collection.  Once we have lots of images and labels, we'll upload this data to a GPU enabled machine where we'll *train* a neural network to predict whether the robot's safety bubble is being violated based off of the image it sees.  We'll use this to implement a simple collision avoidance behavior in the end :)\n",
    "\n",
    "> IMPORTANT NOTE:  When JetBot spins in place, it actually spins about the center between the two wheels, not the center of the robot chassis itself.  This is an important detail to remember when you're trying to estimate whether the robot's safety bubble is violated or not.  But don't worry, you don't have to be exact. If in doubt it's better to lean on the cautious side (a big safety bubble).  We want to make sure JetBot doesn't enter a scenario that it couldn't get out of by turning in place."
